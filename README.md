## User Flow

1. *Initialization*: Admin selects the number of customers for cold calling
2. *Call Generation*: System initiates calls to selected customers
3. *Conversation*: 
   - AI introduces itself and determines customer interest
   - Promotes relevant products based on interest signals
   - Handles objections and answers product questions
4. *Outcome Processing*:
   - If sale occurs: Records details in database
   - If rejected: Logs response for future optimization
5. *Analytics*: Dashboard updates with real-time metrics and call results

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Some phone carriers may block automated calls
- Google STT occasionally misinterprets responses in noisy environments
- Gemini response length needs fine-tuning for optimal conversation flow
- API rate limits may affect performance during high-volume campaigns
- UI responsiveness issues on certain older mobile devices

## Roadmap

### Future Development
- WhatsApp & SMS integration for multi-channel communication
- Multilingual support
- Enhanced call analytics with AI-powered insights
- Agent feedback and coaching for sales effectiveness
- Cloud storage with user authentication
- A/B testing for conversation script optimization
- Voice customization and persona selection
